# ðŸ“œ To Do

## ðŸ¤” What's this about?

During the course of this workshop, you will be required to complete assignments on the project that we build together. These include coding or implementing features, so make sure you've grabbed a cup of coffee! â˜•

Alongwith your assignments, if you wish to learn more React, we suggest you try to build a project on your own by the end of the internship program. 

To help you choose a project, we curated some ideas but you are free to select a project of your choice!

- [Project Ideas here](https://github.com/salikadave/react-workshop-start-here/blob/main/to-do/project-ideas.md)

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Submission Guidelines:

- Must have a `README.md` file in the root directory providing instructions on:
    - How to run the project
    - Challenges / Errors you ran into + how did you fix them
    - Technologies you used
- Preferably deployed to any of the cloud services. (Netlify / Heroku / AWS / Any other service you are comfortable with)

Go all out, you got this! ðŸ”¥
